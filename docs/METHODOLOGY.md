# WireClaim — our approach

QuantCo *Claim to Fame*, team **Bin busy**. One page; the long version with every table is
[`methodology-full.md`](methodology-full.md), and every number below is reproducible from a
script in this repo.

## The clause that decides the game

Per Line Item we submit a Charge `a` and a Limit `b`, against a secret Fair Value `t`. The payoff
table has one row people miss: **when a reviewer wrongfully rejects a fair claim, the issuer is
still paid** (and the reviewer pays `1.5a`). So a fair Charge is owed by *every* opponent, while
an Overcharge is paid only by the few who accept. Measured on Game 62: **16 payers versus 3.**

The Charge is therefore a cliff, not a slope. Game 62, Line Item 1, `t ∈ [8505, 10350)`:

| | Charge | payers | income, one item |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `error404 ai` | 8,504.71 | **16/16** | **136,075** — 87 % of their Game |
| us | 10,349.89 | 3/16 | 31,050 |

They did not out-read the policy. They charged 22 % lower and landed on the right side of a cliff.

## The architecture, in one rule

**The model reads; the engine prices.** No model output is ever a price. Models emit *structured
evidence* — a coverage probability with the policy clause quoted verbatim, a price band, a
quantity — and deterministic code turns evidence into a posterior and the posterior into `(a, b)`.
This ran unattended 100 times, once every 12.6 minutes, in a 60-second window. A prompt that
emits a number cannot be swept, folded or replayed; a prompt that emits evidence can, because the
pricing is then a pure function we can re-run over the whole record in a minute.

## Why our counterfactuals are measurements, not arguments

**The Fair Value is exactly recoverable.** A settled Transaction *rejected while carrying a
non-zero amount* is a wrongful rejection, which proves `a ≤ t` and reveals the Charge; a rejection
at zero proves `a > t`. Together they bracket `t` for every Line Item ever played.

So `scripts/replay_payoffs.py` can score any hypothetical submission against the real Field, with
all sixteen opponents held fixed. Its self-check asserts that our *actual* submission reproduces
the authoritative net for every settled Game — that property is a test, not a comment, because
without it none of the numbers mean anything.

**The bar:** positive on **all four folds** (odd, even, early, late), not merely positive in
total. The noise floor is measured, not assumed: **26,622 over 18 Games** with an identical
prompt, scaling as `√n`. That is ±6,275 for one Game, which is why no single Game ever justified
a change, however vivid.

## What moved money

Both fixes were to the Charge, both found by asking why a *specific* Line Item lost.

- **`BIG_ITEM_CHARGE_SCALE` 1.25 → 1.0**: **+79,240** over 63 Games. Nine Line Items move from
  Overcharge to fair and none move the other way.
- **`CHARGE_TRUST_MEMORY = 1.15`** — raise the Charge only where a wording has been *watched
  settle* (measured log error 0.43, against 0.6 for the model): **+80,613, four folds.** The
  control makes it a channel effect rather than "charge more": doing the same to the model
  channel is **−95,061 and 0/4**.

Replayed over the last 10 Games: **−80,266 → +102,817.**

## The negatives, which are the actual methodology

**11 of 19 numbered hypotheses were measured and rejected**, each with the script that killed it:
a global Charge multiplier (monotone loss), the exact expected-income argmax (loses in all 15
cells), four separate attacks on the Limit (⅓ is the argmax), copying the best rival's ratios
(−280k to −380k), more ensemble draws (draw noise is 1.1 % of the error).

The sharpest example happened in the last hour. We shipped a coverage recalibration on a genuine
calibration table and a clean four-fold sweep — then **reverted it twenty minutes later**, because
checking the *mechanism* showed the model's coverage output is bimodal, so the correction changed
**4 Line Items in 573**. Its +5,057 was not the documented effect at all but an incidental Limit
nudge, and the four-fold test had given false confidence: folds catch a result driven by a few
*Games*, not one driven by a few *items*. A constant can be right about its data and wrong about
its mechanism, and only the mechanism check catches it.

The two traps that each cost a working session: **conditioning on the outcome** (bucketing by what
items turned out to be worth suggests raising the Limit on expensive items; bucketing by `t̂`, the
only thing knowable at submission time, collapses the gradient — of 23 items we believed were
worth over 2,000, **14 were worth under half that**), and **censoring** (an unbounded bracket is
unbounded *because* nobody rightfully rejected, which is selection on the answer).

## Where we stand, honestly

Rank lags: Games 1–25 ran before the current estimator existed and cost 322,595, the whole of our
deficit. Since the Charge fixes went live, eight settled Games run **+10,504 per Game**, against
the best twenty-Game rate anyone in the field managed (+6,435). Eight Games is inside the noise
floor and we say so rather than claiming the win.

The remaining gap is entirely `t̂`: **`a = b = t` reaches 100.3 % of the best possible play and is
within 3 % on 70 of 70 Games**, while `a = b = t̂` scores −50,140. The 2,498,118 between them is
not strategy, it is estimation error — which is why we stopped looking for cleverness in the
decision rules. The largest measured lever still open is coverage, worth **+1,173/Game** if
perfect; it is a prompt problem, not a pricing one, and no pricing rule we tried reached it.
